# #100DaysOfCode
Daily log of everything I worked on during the #100DaysOfCode challenge. These are identical to my tweets I sent over this period.

1. DAY 1. Worked through the regex code examples in The Well-Grounded Rubyist book. You can see my notes at my `well-grounded-rubyist` repo on GitHub. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 2. Worked through the file i/o examples in The Well-Grounded Rubyist book. (similar to yesterday). Nearly done with the book now. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 3. I've finished The Well-Grounded Rubyist book! I feel much better about starting my fellowship course at @makersacademy next Monday. :) I also blogged about my experience here: https://twitter.com/hnryjmes/status/1044174254521102336 #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 4. Finally, time for a real project again. Working on a meetup-style app called 'funrun' built using @vuejs + @vuetifyjs + @firebase! Thanks to @maxedapps for the helpful video tutorial. #100DaysOfCode 

1. DAY 5. Continuing with my funrun project from yesterday, about halfway through the video series. Lots of mistakes by me, the usual typos etc, but I feel like I'm getting a tiny bit more experienced with Vue :) plus today I used Vuex for the first time. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 6. Today was my first really frustrating day. Nothing wrong with the tutorial, but things to do with Vuex and Firebase have changed significantly in the past year and lots of the tutorial ended up being hard to implement. I'm stopping with this today (~ 80% feature complete) and will do something else tomorrow. #100DaysOfCode
