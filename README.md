# #100DaysOfCode
Daily log of everything I worked on during the #100DaysOfCode challenge. These are identical to my tweets I sent over this period.

1. DAY 1. Worked through the regex code examples in The Well-Grounded Rubyist book. You can see my notes at my `well-grounded-rubyist` repo on GitHub. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 2. Worked through the file i/o examples in The Well-Grounded Rubyist book. (similar to yesterday). Nearly done with the book now. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 3. I've finished The Well-Grounded Rubyist book! I feel much better about starting my fellowship course at @makersacademy next Monday. :) I also blogged about my experience here: https://twitter.com/hnryjmes/status/1044174254521102336 #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 4. Finally, time for a real project again. Working on a meetup-style app called 'funrun' built using @vuejs + @vuetifyjs + @firebase! Thanks to @maxedapps for the helpful video tutorial. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 5. Continuing with my funrun project from yesterday, about halfway through the video series. Lots of mistakes by me, the usual typos etc, but I feel like I'm getting a tiny bit more experienced with Vue :) plus today I used Vuex for the first time. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 6. Today was my first really frustrating day. Vuex + Firebase have changed significantly in the past year and lots of the tutorial ended up being hard to implement. I'm stopping with this today (~ 80% feature complete) and will do something else tomorrow. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 7. Back to basics. Learning JavaScript unit testing with Jasmine on Udacity. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 8. Weekend... revising the basics again before I start Makers on Monday. Git and GitHub. I want to know how to branch and merge better. This time I've even got [fellow EA, generally amazing person] Sarah Spikes (pictured, left) to help teach it to me! ☺️ #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 9. Finished off revising the git course, read through all the documents for @makersacademy onsite starting tomorrow! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 10. Pair programming. Ruby class methods etc. Fun to see other people's work, as people will often have a different way to solve the same problem. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 11. Pair programming. Learning about error messages in Ruby! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 12. Pair programming. Using the ruby gem 'pry' which allows you to do breakpoints in programs etc. Learned a lot about debugging tools. Very useful! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 13. Pair programming. Getting to know good testing practices like using doubles to isolate unit tests in RSpec; plus more on TDD generally. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 14. Feeling less good today - only had about an hour to code this morning before going home ill. Did more testing with rspec, trying to resist solving the whole problem in one go, but rather let the features you want fall out of the tests you've written. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 15. Working on the weekend challenge: test driving the development of a basic CLI air traffic controller system, using object-oriented design principles. First step: using the user stories, nouns, verbs to work out which classes and methods we will need. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 16. Still on the airport challenge. Got some basic tests working how I want, now to add some state to each of these classes and track the data flow exactly how I want it. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 17. Pair programming. Focus on test-driven, object-oriented design in Ruby. Building a model of the Transport for London Oyster card system. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 18. I did more pair programming today, but the thing I want to show is the morning exercise we did on refactoring. Basically, you are given a really messy bit of code (e.g. endlessly chained if-blocks, all code in one method) and you have to refactor. Fun! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 19. Refactoring. Learning from Sandi Metz. Same project as yesterday, the gilded rose design project. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 20. Pair programming. Finishing off our oyster card project, learning about forwarding, inheritance, encapsulation, SRP etc. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 21. Getting started on the weekend challenge: test-drive and build a takeaway app that uses the Twilio API to send a text message. Also brushing up on my regex... #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 22. Weekend challenge: more on my takeaway app. Getting to know the ruby Time class! And trying not to get notification texts every time I run rspec... #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 23. Slightly more frustration, tests are passing, just trying to work out why my test coverage is so low.. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 24. Pairing on code review of our weekend projects using GitHub. Getting feedback on your code from others is so valuable, especially in this group environment where you can see how different solutions to the same problem can be. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 25. Learning about HTTP, testing web apps with Capybara. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 26. Pair programming. Building and testing our battle web app with Capybara, mixing in some of our object-oriented design knowledge as well. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 27. Finishing off the web app, switching turns, random damage etc. Thinking about an even bigger web app for this weekend challenge! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 28. Starting the weekend challenge. Who knew rock paper scissors would make such a good web development kata? Really gets you to think about separation of concerns, where to handle business logic etc. #100DaysOfCode
