# #100DaysOfCode
Daily log of everything I worked on during the #100DaysOfCode challenge. These are identical to my tweets I sent over this period.

1. DAY 1. Worked through the regex code examples in The Well-Grounded Rubyist book. You can see my notes at my `well-grounded-rubyist` repo on GitHub. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 2. Worked through the file i/o examples in The Well-Grounded Rubyist book. (similar to yesterday). Nearly done with the book now. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 3. I've finished The Well-Grounded Rubyist book! I feel much better about starting my fellowship course at @makersacademy next Monday. :) I also blogged about my experience here: https://twitter.com/hnryjmes/status/1044174254521102336 #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 4. Finally, time for a real project again. Working on a meetup-style app called 'funrun' built using @vuejs + @vuetifyjs + @firebase! Thanks to @maxedapps for the helpful video tutorial. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 5. Continuing with my funrun project from yesterday, about halfway through the video series. Lots of mistakes by me, the usual typos etc, but I feel like I'm getting a tiny bit more experienced with Vue :) plus today I used Vuex for the first time. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 6. Today was my first really frustrating day. Vuex + Firebase have changed significantly in the past year and lots of the tutorial ended up being hard to implement. I'm stopping with this today (~ 80% feature complete) and will do something else tomorrow. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 7. Back to basics. Learning JavaScript unit testing with Jasmine on Udacity. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 8. Weekend... revising the basics again before I start Makers on Monday. Git and GitHub. I want to know how to branch and merge better. This time I've even got [fellow EA, generally amazing person] Sarah Spikes (pictured, left) to help teach it to me! ☺️ #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 9. Finished off revising the git course, read through all the documents for @makersacademy onsite starting tomorrow! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 10. Pair programming. Ruby class methods etc. Fun to see other people's work, as people will often have a different way to solve the same problem. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 11. Pair programming. Learning about error messages in Ruby! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 12. Pair programming. Using the ruby gem 'pry' which allows you to do breakpoints in programs etc. Learned a lot about debugging tools. Very useful! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 13. Pair programming. Getting to know good testing practices like using doubles to isolate unit tests in RSpec; plus more on TDD generally. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 14. Feeling less good today - only had about an hour to code this morning before going home ill. Did more testing with rspec, trying to resist solving the whole problem in one go, but rather let the features you want fall out of the tests you've written. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 15. Working on the weekend challenge: test driving the development of a basic CLI air traffic controller system, using object-oriented design principles. First step: using the user stories, nouns, verbs to work out which classes and methods we will need. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 16. Still on the airport challenge. Got some basic tests working how I want, now to add some state to each of these classes and track the data flow exactly how I want it. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 17. Pair programming. Focus on test-driven, object-oriented design in Ruby. Building a model of the Transport for London Oyster card system. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 18. I did more pair programming today, but the thing I want to show is the morning exercise we did on refactoring. Basically, you are given a really messy bit of code (e.g. endlessly chained if-blocks, all code in one method) and you have to refactor. Fun! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 19. Refactoring. Learning from Sandi Metz. Same project as yesterday, the gilded rose design project. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 20. Pair programming. Finishing off our oyster card project, learning about forwarding, inheritance, encapsulation, SRP etc. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 21. Getting started on the weekend challenge: test-drive and build a takeaway app that uses the Twilio API to send a text message. Also brushing up on my regex... #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 22. Weekend challenge: more on my takeaway app. Getting to know the ruby Time class! And trying not to get notification texts every time I run rspec... #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 23. Slightly more frustration, tests are passing, just trying to work out why my test coverage is so low.. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 24. Pairing on code review of our weekend projects using GitHub. Getting feedback on your code from others is so valuable, especially in this group environment where you can see how different solutions to the same problem can be. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 25. Learning about HTTP, testing web apps with Capybara. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 26. Pair programming. Building and testing our battle web app with Capybara, mixing in some of our object-oriented design knowledge as well. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 27. Finishing off the web app, switching turns, random damage etc. Thinking about an even bigger web app for this weekend challenge! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 28. Starting the weekend challenge. Who knew rock paper scissors would make such a good web development kata? Really gets you to think about separation of concerns, where to handle business logic etc. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 29. Tests passing on my rock paper scissors weekend challenge project. Time to work on the multiplayer feature! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 30. Adding some screenshots to my weekend project repository before building my pull request. Writing a README is much easier if you do some of it before the project starts, like I actually did this time! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 31. Went to a TensorFlow.js workshop (by @AiJavaScript) and trained a neural network in JavaScript! This is sort of not copy and pasted... #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 32. Learning how to work with databases in Ruby using PostgreSQL. But first, brushing up on my SQL query knowledge... #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 33. Accessing a SQL database using TablePlus for Mac OS X; building a daily diary app. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 34. Bookmark manager app - learning basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) using Ruby/Sinatra. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 35. Modelling the request/response cycle for bookmark manager. Getting used to UML-style modelling which is pretty fun but a little bit fiddly... #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 36. Working on some CSS for my twitter clone; writing log in, log out, and sign up methods. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 37. Trying to finish my unit tests so I can submit a pull request and dash off to the EA Global conference. Only 50% feature complete but I'm proud of the work I've been able to do. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 38. Peer review of the weekend challenge. Getting used to rake, rakefiles, ORMs, setting up databases consistently in other environments. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 39. Trying out JavaScript in @code. Currently rewriting the airport challenge from week 1, test-driving in Jasmine. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 40. Using Chrome Dev Tools. Today, we had an exercise to debug a broken version of FizzBuzz in JS. Getting visibility and following the flow! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 41. Building a thermostat app in JS and basic manipulation of HTML elements using jQuery. Also using the OpenWeatherMap API to search for a city and display the temperature to the user. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 42. Friday morning tech test: rapidly learning a new language. Writing a test-driven FizzBuzz program in Java using JUnit. A work in progress... #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 43. Weekend challenge: build a full bowling scorecard in JS plus frontend, using TDD principles and object-oriented design. Will be interesting to see if others go for one large Game class (me, atm) or if they have lots of small single-responsibility classes. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 44. Taking a break from the weekend challenge after an 8+ hour session yesterday. Playing around with learning TDD in React! Struggling with npm... but I got this far at least. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 45. First team project: build an Airbnb clone. Getting used to Git, merges, branches, and pull requests. Our team decided to use Ruby/Sinatra again for a shorter time to MVP. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 46. More team project. Done the minimum viable product, a little CSS, some more database code, onto the remaining features. Working in a team is harder than expected, especially communicating and listening effectively! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 47. Better day, better teamwork, despite a few personal struggles. Most of the basic user stories done, but still so much more left to go before this feels like a real app. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 48. Finished off main user stories we wanted ready for a feature freeze tomorrow. Today really felt like we looked after each other emotionally as well as supported each other with our work. Better teamwork does come through practice. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 49. Finishing touches. Some CSS, retrospectives, writing up our process. Proud of how much we managed to get done in a week, especially given none of us had any prior experience building software in a team. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 50. Back to the bowling challenge from last weekend. Trying again for the third time to rewrite it from scratch so that the code is actually clean(!) #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 51. Getting to know Node.js. Eventually, I'll be able to write a server that can do stuff, right? For now, I'm just watching videos and considering doing the 'build an HTTP server' side project. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 52. JavaScript week again! Getting to grips with some more advanced language features, reading Eloquent JavaScript, test-driving a single page notes app in vanilla JS. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 53. I've said 'vanilla JS' a lot recently. What's vanilla about it? It can do so much! Also, I love vanilla... Today I'm working on a Tic Tac Toe game, maybe with an AI. We'll see how far I get! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 54. Got the minimax algorithm working. It recursively searches through all possible moves so the AI always wins. Thanks to @CarnesBeau/@freeCodeCamp for the helpful video! Next step: delete all code and rewrite from scratch using TDD. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 55. Writing a notes app in JS, with a homemade JS test suite that runs in Chrome DevTools. Useful stuff for understanding single page applications and RESTful hash routing. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 56. Preparing to do the weekend challenge, making a news summary app that uses the Guardian News API. Trying to learn ES6 syntax at the same time, and how to keep ESLint happy... #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 57. Learning by doing. What's CORS? Finding out through failure. Will I get my second API request to work before the end of the weekend? Seeing red... #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 58. Making a Hacker News clone through test-driven development in vanilla JS! Trying to make a mental model of when the fetch requests to the APIs should run, how to make the page load quicker... I almost feel like a real web developer, lol. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 59. Day one of ten of our two-week engineering project at @makersacademy. Building a Facebook clone using Ruby on Rails. First step: get familiar with Rails, get familiar with the project directory. This will be our last team project before final projects! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 60. Another team day. It's been a significant change from our normal development style of understanding every piece of code as we go along. There's so much syntactic sugar in Rails it's difficult to say what's going on under the hood sometimes. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 61. Adding bootstrap, some CSS, navbar etc. Still working using agile methodology, ticking off things on our waffle.io board. Starting to look a tiny bit like a real app... #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 62. Not quite at banging head against wall phase, but getting there... trying to understand routes and controllers in Ruby on Rails and failing. I think we need to take a break and do some reading until we understand it more... #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 63. Fixed our problems from yesterday! Like feature implemented without refreshing the page :) #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 64. I'm interested in how I might explore RL through research. Advice I've heard: try to replicate code from a recent paper or build something, rather than textbook learning. Maybe I'm not able to do that just yet, but reading papers regularly is a good start! #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 65. Using the weekend to consolidate what we've learned in the week, esp. routing in Rails. Also writing my Viva Thesis and preparing CV, both for Makers careers team. Mainly reading and writing today. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 66. Migrating our app to use AWS. Some problems to say the least... #100DaysOfCode
