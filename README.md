# #100DaysOfCode
Daily log of everything I worked on during the #100DaysOfCode challenge. These are identical to my tweets I sent over this period.

1. DAY 1. Worked through the regex code examples in The Well-Grounded Rubyist book. You can see my notes at my `well-grounded-rubyist` repo on GitHub. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 2. Worked through the file i/o examples in The Well-Grounded Rubyist book. (similar to yesterday). Nearly done with the book now. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 3. I've finished The Well-Grounded Rubyist book! I feel much better about starting my fellowship course at @makersacademy next Monday. :) I also blogged about my experience here: https://twitter.com/hnryjmes/status/1044174254521102336 #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 4. Finally, time for a real project again. Working on a meetup-style app called 'funrun' built using @vuejs + @vuetifyjs + @firebase! Thanks to @maxedapps for the helpful video tutorial. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 5. Continuing with my funrun project from yesterday, about halfway through the video series. Lots of mistakes by me, the usual typos etc, but I feel like I'm getting a tiny bit more experienced with Vue :) plus today I used Vuex for the first time. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 6. Today was my first really frustrating day. Vuex + Firebase have changed significantly in the past year and lots of the tutorial ended up being hard to implement. I'm stopping with this today (~ 80% feature complete) and will do something else tomorrow. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 7. Back to basics. Learning JavaScript unit testing with Jasmine on Udacity. #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 8. Weekend... revising the basics again before I start Makers on Monday. Git and GitHub. I want to know how to branch and merge better. This time I've even got [fellow EA, generally amazing person] Sarah Spikes (pictured, left) to help teach it to me! ☺️ #100DaysOfCode

1. DAY 9.
1. DAY 10.
